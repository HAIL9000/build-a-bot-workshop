The template we're going to base a new bot on, Hello World Bot, is made up of 3 files. **book.txt** is where the text of a book will go. **bot.py** handles selecting chunks of text from the book and tweeting it. Finally, **secrets.py** will hold our authentication secrets which we'll cover in the next section. **secrets.py** is not included in the template repo since we don't want to make our authentication info publicly accessible.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one first at https://github.com/join (the free version will be fine)

##What did we just do?
GitHub is a service that allows us to share projects with others. It uses Git, a program for keeping track of changes to a project. There's nothing about Git or GitHub that's specific to programming. You could use it to keep track of changes to a novel or any other project you might want to share with other people, as long as it can be represented as a group of files.
