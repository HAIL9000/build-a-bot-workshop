# Set up GitHub
* 
If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one first at https://github.com/join (the free version will be fine)
* 
Fork the hello world bot template at https://github.com/tpinecone/hello-world-bot/
* 
Copy the HTTPS clone url for the fork (it should resemble https://github.com/[your username]/hello-world-bot.git)
* 
Go back to the PythonAnywhere bash console and enter git clone [clone url]
* 
cd hello-world-bot

We'll now need to find a book for our bot to tweet from. https://www.gutenberg.org/ has a wide selection of public domain books. Once you've found one, open the Plain Text version.
* 
Open the PythonAnywhere home page in a new tab and go to the "Files" section
* 
Create a book.txt file inside the hello-world-bot directory and paste the text file into it (we could have created it in the bash console, but pasting large amounts of text into the browser bash console can cause problems).
