# Personalize your Bot

There are tons of free, easily accessible data sources you can use to create interesting bots. Some of my favorites are:

* 
**Wikimedia** provides free, public APIs for all of their services including Wikipedia and Wikihow. Uses simple GET requests with no authentication required. There is [documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) as well as a [Python wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wikipedia/). Cool bots that use the Wikimedia API include [@wikisext](https://twitter.com/wikisext) and [@how2butt](https://twitter.com/how2butt).
* **Tweepy**, the library we used to send tweets from our sample bot, can also be used to search and reply to tweets. Tweepy is very [well documented](http://tweepy.readthedocs.org/en/v3.2.0/).
* **Google** has a lot of different free, public APIs that have basic authentication and usage limit requirements. The whole list of Google APIs is [here](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/). [@earthroverbot](https://twitter.com/EarthRoverBot) and [@youareherebot](https://twitter.com/youareherebot/with_replies) use the [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en) API.

Happy building!
