# Personalize your Bot

There are tons of free, easily accessible data sources you can use to create interesting bots. Some of my favorites are:



## 

* 
**Wikimedia** provides free, public APIs for all of their services including Wikipedia and Wikihow. Uses simple GET requests with no authentication required. There is [documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) as well as a [Python wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wikipedia/).
* **Tweepy**, the library we used to send tweets from our sample bot, can also be used to search and reply to tweets. Tweepy is very [well documented](http://tweepy.readthedocs.org/en/v3.2.0/).
