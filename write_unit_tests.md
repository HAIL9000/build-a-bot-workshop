# Write unit tests for your bot

Sweet! Your bot is tweeting on a schedule, and you're on your way to Twitter bot superstardom! But what if you want to add some changes to your bot down the line? How can we verify that your changes won't break any of the current behavior?

We can safely make changes and additions to our bot through the magic of ✨unit tests✨!
