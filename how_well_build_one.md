# How we'll build one
For this workshop, we'll start by making a simple template bot that tweets the text of a book 140 characters at a time. Then, we'll change its behavior to make a new bot. To do this we will:

* Make an account on PythonAnywhere
* 
Clone the bot template from GitHub and find a book for it to tweet
* Set up a Twitter acount for the bot
* Test that the bot can tweet to the account we set up for it
* Schedule the bot to run once per day (we'll go over paid hosting options that will allow you to tweet multiple times per day)
* Come up with interesting ideas and implement them
* Add the bot to the [Bot Wiki](https://botwiki.org/bots/twitterbots)
