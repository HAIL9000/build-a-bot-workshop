# Tell people about your bot

There are a number of ways to share your bot with other botmakers. You can tweet about it using #botALLY or #botmakers.

Add a description for your bot to add it to the BotWiki [here](http://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot). You can direct any questions to [Stefan Bohacek](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish).
