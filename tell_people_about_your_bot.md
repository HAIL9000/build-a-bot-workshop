# Tell people about your bot

There are a number of ways to share your bot with other botmakers. You can tweet about it using [#botALLY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23botALLY&src=tyah) or [#botmakers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/botmakers?src=hash).

Add a description for your bot to add it to the BotWiki [here](http://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot). You can direct any questions to [Stefan Bohacek](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish).
