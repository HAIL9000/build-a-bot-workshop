I am indebted to:

Stefan Bohacek for writing https://botwiki.org/, a hugely important resource for me and for this workshop.
Thursday Bram for encouraging me to speak at PyDX, even though I had very little Python experience and even less speaking experience.
Lacey Williams for giving me the opportunity to talk about how much I love Twitter bots at Django Girls PDX this summer, and for being an amazing and inspiring co-organizer.
@thricedotted for writing the first bot I read that made me spit out my drink from laughter (the esteemed @wikisext).
Nate Smith for teaching me about Twitter bots and supporting me in everything I do.
