I am indebted to:
* 
[Stefan Bohacek](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) for writing https://botwiki.org/, a hugely important resource for me and for this workshop.
* 
[Thursday Bram](https://twitter.com/thursdayb) for encouraging me to speak at PyDX, despite having very little Python experience and even less speaking experience.
* 
[Lacey Williams](https://twitter.com/laceynwilliams) for giving me the opportunity to talk about how much I love Twitter bots at [Django Girls PDX](http://djangogirls.org/portland) this summer, and for being an amazing and inspiring co-organizer.
* 
[@thricedotted](https://twitter.com/thricedotted) for writing the first bot I read that made me spit out my drink from laughter (the esteemed [@wikisext](https://twitter.com/wikisext)).
* 
[Nate Smith](https://twitter.com/nate_smith) for teaching me about Twitter bots and supporting me in everything I do.
