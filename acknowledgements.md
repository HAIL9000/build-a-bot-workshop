I am indebted to 
* 
[Thursday Bram](https://twitter.com/thursdayb) for encouraging me to speak at PyDX, despite having very little Python experience and even less speaking experience.
* 
[Nate Smith](https://twitter.com/nate_smith) for teaching me about Twitter bots, and supporting me in everything I do.
