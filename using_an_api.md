# Using an API
An API is a set of instructions that programs can use to talk to each other. You've already been using the Twitter API to tell Twitter that your bot has permission to tweet on the account you created for it.

Let's use a much simpler example to look at how an API works. Try visiting the url http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/ in your browser.

This url is an endpoint of the Pok√©api. It has extensive documentation at https://pokeapi.co/ which describes all the different kinds of urls you can use to see Pokemon data.

The pile of text you're seeing is JSON, a data format that most programming languages can understand.
