Welcome to the Build-a-Bot workshop!
=======
This is a workshop for Python developers who are interested in making small, creative programming projects and have never made a Twitter bot before. We'll walk  you through setting up a simple Twitter bot that tweets lines of a book 140 characters at a time. Then, we'll move on to customizing it using free, publicly accessible data sources and our imaginations. ðŸŒˆ

Our tools will be
* 
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com), where our bot's output will go.
* 
[Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/), a Python library to simplify the Twitter API and authentication process
* Hosting and scheduling on
[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com), a hosting service which has a browser UI for everything we'll be doing today so that you won't need to install anything onto your personal computer.
* 
Version control on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* 
Public domain books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) for our practice bot.

Everyone has different skill levels and experience, so don't worry if you aren't familiar with some of these tools. We'll go into more depth about them in the next sections and you can always ask questions.
