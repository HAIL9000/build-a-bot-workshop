# Test your bot
The bot should be all ready to go. Go to the PythonAnywhere bash console, cd into hello-world-bot, and run ``python3 bot.py`` to test it. If everything has been set up correctly, the command will run without errors, a tweet will be posted to the bot's account, and the text of the tweet will be removed from book.txt.
