# Test your bot
The bot should be all ready to go. We can test it by going to the hello-world-bot directory in the PythonAnywhere bash console and typing python3 bot.py. If everything has been set up correctly, the command will run without errors, a tweet will be posted to the bot's account, and the text of the tweet will be removed from book.txt.![](Screen Shot 2015-09-29 at 11.28.35 PM.png)
